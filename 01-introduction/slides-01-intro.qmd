# Introduction

## About Us

- Stephanie Zimmer, RTI International

- Rebecca Powell, Fors Marsh

- Isabella Velásquez, Posit

::: {.notes}
Each of us give a brief intro on our experience/background
:::

## Prerequisites - tidyverse familiarity

::: {.incremental}
- Selecting a set of variables (`select(starts_with("TOT"))`)
- Creating new variables with `mutate()`
- Summarizing data with `summarize()`
- Using `group_by()` with `summarize()` to create group summaries
:::

## Background {.smaller}

- This tutorial largely builds off our book: Exploring Complex Survey Data Analysis Using R
  - <https://tidy-survey-r.github.io/site/>
- This book covers additional topics outside this tutorial including:
  - Overview of survey process
  - Linear regression and logistic regression
  - Communication of results (tables and plots)
  - Reproducible research best practices

- Not covered
   - Weighting (calibration, post-stratification, raking, etc.)
   - Survival analysis
   - Nonlinear models

## How is survey analysis different?

- Data often includes weights. These weights extrapolate each response to the population of interest
- Data is often sampled in a complex manner using strata or clusters. This impacts how standard errors are calculated
- Fortunately, the packages we discuss today do the hard math for you using tidyverse syntax you're familiar with

## Overview of tutorial

- At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to 
   - Calculate point estimates and their standard errors with survey data 
      - Proportions, totals, and counts
      - Means, quantiles, and correlations
   - Perform t-tests and chi-squared tests
   - Specify a survey design in R to create a survey object

::: {.notes}
- This tutorial focuses on the Analysis step
- We assume you are working with public use or restricted use files that already have weights
- As time allows, we may touch on reporting

## Roadmap for today

- Getting started
- Descriptive analysis
- Statistical testing
- Survey design objects

## Logistics

- We will be using Posit Cloud for exercises 
- All materials are found at:
