# Descriptive statistics



## Descriptive analysis with survey data

## Introduction

_Descriptive analyses_ lay the groundwork for the next steps of running statistical tests or developing models.

## Introduction

[show example]

if only 10% of survey respondents are male, it could indicate a unique population, a potential error or bias, an intentional survey sampling method, or other factors.

## Introduction

Calculate point estimates of...

*Unknown population parameters*, such as mean.

. . .

*Uncertainty estimates*, such as confidence intervals.

## Types of data

* Categorical/nominal data: variables with levels or descriptions that cannot be ordered, such as the region of the country (North, South, East, and West)
Ordinal data: variables that can be ordered, such as those from a Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree)
Discrete data: variables that are counted or measured, such as number of children
Continuous data: variables that are measured and whose values can lie anywhere on an interval, such as income

## Types of measures

Measures of distribution describe how often an event or response occurs. These measures include counts and totals. We cover the following functions:

* Count of observations (survey_count() and survey_tally())
* Summation of variables (survey_total())

Measures of central tendency find the central (or average) responses. These measures include means and medians. We cover the following functions:

    Means and proportions (survey_mean() and survey_prop())
    Quantiles and medians (survey_quantile() and survey_median())

Measures of relationship describe how variables relate to each other. These measures include correlations and ratios. We cover the following functions:

    Correlations (survey_corr())
    Ratios (survey_ratio())

Measures of dispersion describe how data spread around the central tendency for continuous variables. These measures include standard deviations and variances. We cover the following functions:

    Variances and standard deviations (survey_var() and survey_sd())

## Count of observations

Using `survey_count()` and `survey_tally()`, we can calculate the estimated population counts for a given variable or combination of variables.

- These summaries, often referred to as cross-tabulations or cross-tabs, are applied to categorical data.

## `survey_count` syntax

- `survey_count` functions similarly to `dplyr::count` in that it is <b>NOT</b> called within `summarize`.
- Produces weighted counts and variance of your choice of those counts.

```r
survey_count(
   x,
   ...,
   wt = NULL,
   sort = FALSE,
   name = "n",
   .drop = dplyr::group_by_drop_default(x),
   vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv")
)
```

## `survey_count` example

Cross-tab of population in each age group and gender:

```r
recs_des %>%
  survey_count()
```
